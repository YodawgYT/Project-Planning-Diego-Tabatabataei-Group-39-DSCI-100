    "# In this project, we will be exploring two different data sets related to a study conducted by a research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood. \n",
    "#These 2 files are a part of a study conducted in Minecraft to help train an AI to identify different levels of skill in gameplay, so that it can mimic them with precision.\n",
    "# The two files being explored are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1: - players.csv: Which covers the data from the participants, or in this case, the \"players\". The player's data contains 7 variables, which are the following:\n",
    "# experience: The experience column is split into 5 factors, or categories you can fall under. Pro, Veteran, Regular, Amateur, and Beginner. Categorizing a player was done by analyzing gameplay with AI.\n",
    "# subscribe: It's a logical column with TRUE or FALSE, indicating if the participant is still actively subscribed to the research project newsletter.\n",
    "# hashedEmail: Encryption of the email the participant submitted for contacting purposes.\n",
    "# played_hours: The number of hours each player has devoted to the project, and the amount of time the AI analyzed their gameplay.\n",
    "# name: The name the participant is identified with.\n",
    "# Age: The age of the participant.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2: - sessions.csv: The data of the gameplay sessions for each participant, respectively. The session's data contains 5 variables, which are the following:\n",
    "# hashedEmail: Encryption of the email the participant submitted for contacting purposes.\n",
    "# start_time: The moment the start of the gameplay session occurred, with the day, month, year, and time.\n",
    "# end_time: The moment the end of the gameplay session occurred, with the day, month, year, and time.\n",
    "# original_start_time: Another way the start time of the gameplay is stored.\n",
    "# original_end_time: Another way the end time of the gameplay is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now that both Files have been analyzed, throughout, I've noticed a few issues, especially with the sessions data. The fact that it doesn't contain player names makes it very hard to identify which player is the one playing that session.\n",
    "# The reason why I believe it's important is that you can see how far a player has progressed throughout the game, and relate it to the time it took them to get there, to measure skill. Being able to relate that to the player name could help find correlations and relationships with variables in the player data, such as age and gender.\n",
    "# Another issue I see is that there isn't a description in the CSV files, explaining what each variable may mean. Perhaps the original_start_time in the sessions.csv may mean something that we don't know without a solid explanation.\n",
    "# Finally, another issue I have with the data set is that on the surface level, by simply looking at the variables, there aren't too many good predictive variables that we can use to decipher a relationship between a variable and experience. A good addition could be a question the participant what the main device they play games on. E.g: Mobile, PlayStation, Pc, Xbox, Etc. That way we can use more predictive variables to find out what makes a player more experienced than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Broad question I will be picking is Question 1: What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "# Reason being is that by being able to make a predictive K-NN model, I can train the model to be able to predict whether a certain player with certain parameters will be likely to subscribe to the newsletter. This would yield a great return to the research team in having a returning participation pool to further train the data.\n",
    "# Now that the broad question has been established, my specific question will be “Can age and experience predict experience in the players' data set?”\n",
    "# The reason for my question choice is that the age of the participant and the experience could be a good predictor of whether the player will subscribe to the newsletter. A high level of experience could indicate a great interest in Minecraft, and would show interest in supporting the game from the front, in this case, through AI research. Age would show how the age of the participant may influence their decision in subscribing or not, young participants may only want to partake just to play, whilst older players may particiapte for the sake of research rather than enjoyment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# METHODS AND PLAN\n",
    "# The method I will be using is creating a K-NN model and using cross validation to predict the class \n",
    "# - Why is this method appropriate?\n",
    "# - Which assumptions are required, if any, to apply the method selected?\n",
    "# - What are the potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected?\n",
    "# - How are you going to compare and select the model?\n",
    "# - How are you going to process the data to apply the model? For example: Are you splitting the data? How? How many splits? What proportions will you use for the splits? At what stage will you split? Will there be a validation set? Will you use cross validation?"
